# Python Challenge

This repository contains the necessary script to achieve the results as requested in the Python Module Challenge.

## Dependencies

This script was tested in *Python v3.11.0*.

Each script can be run independently within their respective directories. They were tested by opening the terminal in the directory where the script is located and running the following command for PyBank:

```
py PyBank.py
```
And the following command for PyPoll:

```
py PyPoll.py
```
## Credits
Stack Overflow was referenced for minor syntax questions and module availability issues. As classes are fast-paced, having the slides from class and the Zoom recordings available to sift through were essential to the completion of this challenge. 

Study groups with fellow classmates Dustin, Tatiana, and Miggy also came in clutch.

Professor Irfan is also to thank as always for his patience and guidance.

Coding Sountrack for this week was Killswitch Engage's [End of Heartache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhLxCw4OFes&list=PLN18IemGQLuUD7x8YJdU38Tq8a94TLWDs).
